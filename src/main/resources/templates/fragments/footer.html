    footer.html - Shared footer fragment (Thymeleaf)
    ============================================================
    THYMELEAF NOTES:

    th:fragment="footer" defines a named fragment.
    Other templates include it via: th:replace="~{fragments/footer :: footer}"

    Unlike JSP includes (compile-time copy-paste), Thymeleaf fragments
    are processed at render-time. Each page is a complete, valid HTML file
    that can be previewed in a browser without a running server.
    This is called "Natural Templates" - a key Thymeleaf advantage over JSP.
