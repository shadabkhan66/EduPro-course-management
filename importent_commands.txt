Git Tags -- What and Why
A tag is a permanent bookmark on a specific commit. Unlike branches (which move forward with new commits), a tag stays fixed. It's how you say "this exact commit is version 1.0.0".
Two types of tags:
Type	Command	What It Stores
Lightweight	git tag v1.0.0	Just a pointer to a commit (like a sticky note)
Annotated (recommended)	git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "message"	Full object: tagger name, date, message, and can be signed
Always use annotated tags for releases -- they show up in git log, carry metadata, and are the industry standard.
Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
The standard format is vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
v1.0.0 │ │ │ │ │ └── PATCH: bug fixes (backward compatible) │ └──── MINOR: new features (backward compatible) └────── MAJOR: breaking changes
Examples:
Version	When
v0.1.0	First working prototype (your project is here)
v0.2.0	Added pagination, tests, etc.
v0.2.1	Fixed a bug in pagination
v1.0.0	Production-ready, stable API
v2.0.0	Redesigned the whole architecture (breaking change)
Why v0.x.x? -- The 0 major version signals "this is pre-release / in development." Your pom.xml already has <version>0.1.0</version> which is perfect.
Commands You'll Run
Step 1: Make sure everything is committed
git status
If you have uncommitted changes, commit them first.
Step 2: Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial stable version: course CRUD, Spring Security, H2/Oracle support"
This tags your current HEAD commit as v0.1.0.
Step 3: Verify the tag
# List all tagsgit tag# See tag detailsgit show v0.1.0
git show v0.1.0 will display the tagger, date, message, and the commit it points to.
Step 4: Push the tag to GitHub
# Push a specific taggit push origin v0.1.0# Or push ALL tags at oncegit push origin --tags
Tags are not pushed by git push alone -- you must explicitly push them.
After Pushing -- GitHub Release
Once the tag is on GitHub, you can create a Release from it:
Go to your repo on GitHub
Click Releases (right sidebar)
Click "Create a new release"
Select your tag v0.1.0
Add release title: v0.1.0 -- Initial Stable Version
Add release notes (you can paste from your CHALLENGES.md or summarize features)
This creates a nice release page with a download link -- looks very professional on a portfolio repo.

Your Next Version Roadmap
Version	Milestone
v0.1.0	Now -- initial stable (CRUD, auth, H2, docs)
v0.2.0	Add pagination + unit tests
v0.3.0	Add REST API endpoints
v1.0.0	Production-ready with full test coverage
So when you're ready, commit any pending changes, then run:
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial stable version: course CRUD, Spring Security, H2/Oracle support"git push origin v0.1.0
That's it -- your first versioned release!
